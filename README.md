RSocket Android

Demo for RSocket communication between a Spring Boot backend and an Android client. Displays coordinate changes on a map with a slider to alter the coordinate change speed.

Start the backend by executing

> gradle bootRun

You can start the Android client on the emulator from Android studio. If you want to see it on a real client, you need to change the ip address from UfoSocket.kt
